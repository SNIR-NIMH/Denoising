1. 2D and 3D training folders contain atlas folders. These folders contain 
2D/3D atlas image pairs in the format, atlasX_M1.tif and atlasX_GT.tif, X=1,2,3..
There are two models at epoch 1 and 50.

2. The naming convention should strictly be followed. M1 (modality 1) images are
noisy images, and GT images are noise free (ground truth). The noise free images
are usually obtained by averaging hundreds of repeats of the noisy images. 

3. For 2D training, a time-series acquisition can be obtained for a slice. Then the 
time series can be averaged to get a 2D GT image. 

4. For 3D training, the time series should be obtained per slice without moving the
microscope to avoid small microscope movement error.

5. To create an average, 16bit images must be converted to 32bit before averaging.
This can be done in Fiji->Image->Type->32bit

6. The test_data folder contains a 3D image, its denoised version using 2D and 3D
models.
